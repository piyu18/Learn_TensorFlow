# Tensorflow 
Tensorflow is an open-source end-to-end machine learning library for preprocessing data, modelling data and serving models. Rather than building machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, it's more likely we'll use a library such as TensorFlow. This is because it contains many of the most common machine learning functions we want to use.
